Subject: [RFC PATCH v3 0/3] ACPI: PPTT(Processor Properties Topology Table) driver

PPTT(Processor Properties Topology Table) is introduced in ACPI 6.2 spec. It is
used to describe the topological structure of processors, and their shared
resources, such as caches.

PPTT uses processor hierarchy node structures to describe the hierarchy structure
of processors, but doesn't provide means to distinguish whether a node structure
represents a HW thread in an SMT system or a core. The architecture specific code can
use mechanisms provided by the relevant processor architecture to discover this
distinction.

This patchset parse the PPTT table into a tree structure, so that the architecture
specific code can use this structure to build its own cpu topology. Also, this
patchset add PPTT support for arm64.

Changelog:
v3:	add cache and id resources for processor_topology_node structure
	reconstruct a lot
v2:	add platform specific code for arm64.
